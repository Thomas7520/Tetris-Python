Warning : Because of the school program, we were not allowed to use classes. This is why our code isn't OOP. We also cannot use SQL database, only .txt, .json or .csv. Anyway, this game is made for in a localhost way. Of course, with a bit networking system, we could use it with a server, but that's not the main goal of this semester project. It was to build a project on tkinter with knowledge aquired the previous semester.

First, before launching the program you have to install some librarys :

    pip install customtkinter
    pip install CTkMessagebox
    pip install pillow
    pip install threading
    pip install 

To launch the program go on the main.py file and enjoy !
